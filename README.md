- 👋 Hello, I’m Hanna.
- 👀 I’m interested in reading and writing. Why am I in a stem school?
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the foundations of computer science because I was forced to take that class. And since I'm learning Python, I can practice it on GitHub.
- 📫 How to reach me: No.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have no clue how this website works.
- Ciao.
