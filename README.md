- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Hanna.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in reading and writing. Why am I in a stem school?
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the foundations of computer science because I was forced to take that class. And since I'm learning Python, I can practice it on GitHub.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: uhhhh email me at ravenclawgirl2023@gmail.com?
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have no clue how this website works.
- Ciao.
